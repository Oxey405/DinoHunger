# DinoHunger
This is the [GDEVELOP](https://gdevelop-app.com) project of DinoHunger. You must open it in the gdevelop software.
## Description
This game is called **DinoHunger**. This game is just about a dino who want to... eat meat. Yes really interesting. But what **really** makes the thing interesting is the retro-style gameplay. It's just like a Game&Watch (yes it's old like 80's so it's like dinosaur period (joking))
